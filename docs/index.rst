An implementation of the methodology pioneered by `Alkauskas et al. <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.075202>`_ for computing nonradiative recombination rates from first principles.
The code includes various utilities for processing first principles calculations and preparing the input for computing capture coefficients.
More details on the implementation of the code can be found in `our recent paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108056>`_.
If you use our code, please consider citing it (see :doc:`citation`).

The code is hosted on `github <https://github.com/mturiansky/nonrad>`_.
